			<p>The very name Jeppiaar has grown to be synonymous with excellence in education and the Jeppiaar Educational Trust was formed in 1987, with the sole purpose of providing cutting edge technical education that is both accessible and affordable by establishing premier colleges of Engineering and Management studies. Under the aegis of our honourable Chairman, the esteemed Dr. Jeppiaar, Jeppiaar Engineering College was inaugurated on 15th August 2001 as one of the spearheading institutions of Jeppiaar Educational Trust. The director of the college Mrs. Regeena. J. Murli,B.E.,M.B.A.,(PhD), daughter of Col.Dr.Jeppiaar, has led the college from its fledgling state to an institution to reckon with. The vision of our director and her dedication to the cause of technical education combined with her dynamic approach to leadership has made a telling difference to the growth of the college. The boundless energy of Dr. Sushil Lal Das, principal of the college, is also a source of inspiration to our students.</p>
			<p>Jeppiaar Engineering college is affiliated to Anna University and in the short period since it was started has grown into an institution that provides excellent technical education while keeping the overall growth and development of the students in mind. Both academic and non-academic activities are given equal importance, at Jeppiaar Engineering College we take our students’ success very seriously. Accomplished staff, quality driven innovation and superior accountability are the reasons for the students achievements both in academic and co-curricular activities. The college is committed to equip future graduates with the knowledge and skills necessary to work and excel in the ever more competitive global environment.</p>
